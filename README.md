# normalize-opentype.css

Add sound OpenType defaults to [Normalize.css](https://github/necolas/normalize.css).

CSS cascades by nature, so when a certain property interrupt that core principle, it can be very disruptive. Unfortunately, due to browser support, this is the case with a great feature of CSS3: `font-feature-settings`.
<!-- Etc. What font feature settings is, why the cascading isn’t there, how this helps. -->
